# Smart-parking-system
In this system, the image of the license number plate of the vehicle is acquired. It is further
segmented to obtain individual characters in the number plate. Ultrasonic sensors are used
to detect free parking slots. Then the images of number plate are taken and analysed.
Image processing is used to capture the number plate and store in database for comparison
to avoid illegal car entry. The LCD displays whether a car can be parked or not. LEDs and
buzzer are also included to indicate if a car can be parked in a particular slot.
Thus, we aim to propose a car parking system that represents a fully automated model
with minimum human intervention and overcome the limitations of existing systems.
